# What is this?
This is Heimdall, a program that allows you to run your basic shell commands like `cat, ls, code` on a file right from your current directory without having to change into the directory the file exists in.

# Why this?
I mostly work on multiple projects on my machine concurrently and sometimes I am always navigating to different directories to open directories. Heimdall helps me to run any shell command on any file on my machine without having to navigate to the directory.

Add GOPATH to Paths
`export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin`
